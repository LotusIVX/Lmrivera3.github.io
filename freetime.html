	<p id="freetimeintro"> In my free time, I enjoy virtual adventures with my husband. Below are two games that we've been working our way through and a brief description of what each game is about. </p>
	<div id="wonderlandspic"><img src="assets/tinytinawonderlands.jpg" width="638" height="359" alt=""></div>
	<p id="wonderlandsintro">Similar to its predecessors, the game is a first-person shooter with elements of an action role-playing game. The game can be played solo or with up to three other players in online or local split-screen multiplayer. The game is set within the world of a fantasy-themed tabletop role-playing game.[2] The game features an overworld, which is used by the playable characters to traverse the various locations in the game. There are random combat encounters and quests that can only be completed in the overworld.</p>
	<div id="Groundedpic"><img src="assets/grounded.jpg" width="638" height="359" alt=""></div>
	<p id="groundedintro">Grounded is a survival game that can be played either in first-person or a third-person. In the game, the protagonist is shrunk to the size of an ant and must strive to survive in a backyard. In the game, the player character (Max, Willow, Pete or Hoops) needs to consume an adequate amount of food and water, or they will lose health due to starvation or dehydration respectively. The backyard is filled with various bugs and insects, such as spiders, bees, dust mites, ladybugs and many more. The specific microfauna featured in the game suggests the setting to be somewhere in North America as the majority of species featured may be readily found there, although a few (such as the Orchid Mantis) are not native but could reasonably be considered invasive. Different insects serve different purposes in the game. </p>
